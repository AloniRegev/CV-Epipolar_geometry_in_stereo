# University of Haifa CV - Epipolar Geometry In Stereo

## About
The goal is to practice the application and quality assessment of an estimated fundamental matrix. We will visualize the epipolar lines that result from a set of hand marked correspondences and compute the Epipolar and Algebraic distance measures.
